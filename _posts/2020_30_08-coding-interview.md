During the process to be hired as a developer, you will be probably asked to pass an online coding test.

No matter your experience, this kind of tests can be hard and stressful.

In this article, you will get some tips to make your coding test better.

### Before starting

#### When to take the test?
Knowing your best time in the day to code is essential. Try to make the test at that time.
In my experience, in the early morning, my brain feels fresher and less tired than any other moment during the day.

#### Master the coding platform

Take some moments to master the platform you will be coding on.
**Don't skip tutorials**. They will take less than a minute, and you will have a clear understanding about how it works.
Some important things you should know before starting code is:
- **How the challenge gets started**
- **How to submit** your solution
- How to check the **remaining time**
- How to select the **programming language to code**

Note: If allowed, **use your daily work tools**. Things like autocompletion and running/testing your code in a known environment is helpful.

#### Avoid distractions
- **Use a single tab browser screen**. Close any other tabs that could distract you.
- **Turn off notifications**: Be focused on the task and try to avoid distractions: Turn off your mobile phone, watch, browser/OS notifications, etc.
- **Prepare your environment to concentrate at your best**. Does music distract you when coding? Don't play any.

#### Other things to consider
- Before coding have some **healthy food and plenty of water**. Your brain must be energized.
- **A clean desk** will free your mind and let it to focus on the code task.
- **Have some water near you**: Being hydrated during the test will make you think better.
- **Avoid interruptions**: go to the toilet before starting coding

### Understand the test problem

- **Read the instructions** very carefully. If you are not native in the description language, **look for the word translations you don't know**.
- Don't feel overwhelmed if the test includes a large description. Read it **step by step**, writing down the requirements of the problem.
- Before thinking in a solution, spend some time to **understand every aspect of the problem**.
- **Identify the average cases, but also the edge ones**.

### Let's code!

- **Try different approaches**. Think about patterns that could fit. Sometimes, reversing the problem is a good approach.
- Create a lot of test cases. **A great test plan is key for a great solution**.
- **Work on the performance**: Your code will be tested in extreme cases. Time measuring and performance testing could find issues in those cases.
- **Make the code understandable**: Indentation, proper variables names, etc. If you are using an IDE that supports linting, use it.

- Are you feeling **tired or blocked?** Stand up for a few minutes, stretch, etc.
- **Control the remaining time**: Keep enough time to submit your solution without rushing.

### Before submit

- Include a **readme / code explanation** for the reviewer.
- If needed, **comment any part of the code that could be relevant for the reviewer**.
- **Remove console outputs** from the code. They could make some tests failing by timeout errors.
- In case you are coding on an external IDE, bring the latest code to the online platform before submitting.
- **Relaunch the tests** to be sure they pass before submission.
