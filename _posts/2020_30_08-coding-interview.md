During the process to be hired as a developer, you will be probably asked to pass an online coding test.
No matter your experience, this kind of tests can be hard and stressful.
In this article, I will give you some tips to improve your coding test.

### Before starting

#### When to take the test
Knowing your best time in the day to code is essential. Try to make the test at that time.
In my experience, in the early morning my brain feels fresher and less tired than after several hours after waking up.

#### Know the platform
Take some moments to explore the platform. Some of these webs will show you a tutorial: Don't skip it.
It will take less than a minute, and you will have a clear understanding about how it works.

Be sure you know things like:
- **How to start** the challenge
- **How to submit** your solution
- How to check the **remaining time**
- How to select the **programming language to code**

#### Avoid distractions
- **Use a single tab browser screen**. Close any other tabs that could distract you.
- **Turn off notifications**: Be focused on the task and try to avoid distractions: Turn off your mobile phone, watch, browser/OS notifications, etc.
- **Prepare your environment to concentrate at your best**. Does music distract you when coding? Don't play any.

#### Other things to consider
- Before coding have some **healthy food and plenty of water**. Your brain must be energized.
- **A clean desk** will free your mind and let it to focus on the code task.
- **Have some water near you**: Being hydrated during the test will make you think better.
- **Avoid interruptions**: go to the toilet before starting coding

### Understand the proposed problem

- **Read the instructions** very carefully.
- If you are not native in the description language, **look for the word translations you don't know**.
- Don't feel overhelmed if you see a large description. **Read step by step**, writing down the requirements of the problem.
- Spend some time to **clarify every aspect of the problem**, before thinking in a solution.

### Coding the tests
- **Where to code?** If allowed, use your preferred IDE. Autocompletion and running/testing in a known environment is key.

- Try to **identify the average cases and go for it. Have the edge cases in mind, but include them later.**
- Think about patterns you know that could fit the problem, **try different approaches**. Sometimes, reversing the problem is a good approach.
- **Testing**: Making tests is key for a good solution.
- **Work on the performance**: Your code will be tested with large data bunchs and edge cases. Making performance testing could find issues in these cases.

- Are you feeling **tired or blocked?** Stand up for a few minutes, stretch, etc. Look for the way to **relax and reset your brain**.
- **Control the remaining time**: Keep enough time to submit your solution without rushing.

### Submission

Here is a list you cna check before submitting your solution:

- Include a **readme / test explanation**.
- If needed, **comment any aspect of your code that could be relevant for the reviewer.
- Improve the **code readability**: Indentation, proper variables names, etc. If you are using an IDE that support linting, use it before submitting the code.
- **Remove console output** from the code. They could make some tests failing by timeout errors.
- In case you are coding on an external IDE, bring the latest code to the online platform before submitting.
- **Relaunch the tests** to be sure they pass before submission.
