During the process to be hired as a developer, you will be probably asked to pass an online coding test.
No matter your experience, this kind of tests can be hard and stressful.
In this article, I will give you some tips to improve your coding test.

### Before starting

#### When to take the test
Knowing your best time in the day to code is essential. Try to make the test at that time.
In my experience, in the early morning my brain feels fresher and less tired than after several hours after waking up.

#### Know the platform
Take some moments to explore the platform. Some of these webs will show you a tutorial: Don't skip it.
It will take less than a minute, and you will have a clear understanding about how it works.

Be sure you know things like:
- **How to start** the challenge
- **How to submit** your solution
- How to check the **remaining time**
- How to select the **programming language to code**

##### Avoid distractions
- Use a single tab browser screen. Close any other tabs that could distract you.
- Turn off notifications: Be focused on the task and try to avoid distractions: Turn off your mobile phone, watch, browser/OS notifications, etc.
- Prepare the environment to concentrate at your best. Does music distract you when coding? Don't play any.

#### Other things to consider
- Have some healthy food before coding and plenty of water. Your brain must be energized.
- A clean desk will free your mind and let it to focus on the code task.
- Have some water near you: Being hydrated during the test will make you think better.
- Avoid interruptions: go to the bathroom before starting.

- Work on the regular cases, then go for the edge ones.

- Try, try and try
- Use your preferred IDE (Xcode for Swift

- Xcode for testing

### Submission
- Add a readme
