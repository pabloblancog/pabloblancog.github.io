During the process to be hired as a developer, you will be probably asked to pass an online coding test. No matter your experience, this kind of tests can be hard and stressful. 
In this article, you will get some tips to make your coding test better.



## 1. Prepare the test

### When to take the test?
Knowing your best time to code during the day is essential.

In my experience, in the early morning, my brain feels fresher and less tired than any other moment during the day.



### Master the coding platform

Take some moments to master the platform you will be coding. Don't skip tutorials.
Some important things you should know before starting code is:
- How the challenge gets started
- How to submit your solution
- How to check the remaining time
- How to select the programming language to code

If allowed, use your daily work tools. Autocompletion and running/testing your code in a known environment is helpful.

### Avoid distractions
- Use a single tab browser screen: Close anything that could distract you.
- Turn off notifications: mobile phone, watch, browser/OS notifications, etc.
- Prepare your environment to be concentrated at your best (music, noises, chair, clothes, people around, etc.)

### Make your body ready
- Have some healthy food and plenty of water before coding. Your brain must be energized.
- Clean your desk: It will free your mind and let it focus on coding.
- Have some water near you: Being hydrated during the test will make you think better.
- Avoid interruptions: Go to the toilet before starting.


## 2. Code the solution

### Understand the test problem

- Read the instructions nice and slow. If case you are not a native speaker, look for the word translations you don't know.
- Don't feel overwhelmed about large descriptions. Read them step by step, writing down the requirements of the problem.
- Understand every aspect of the problem: Identify the average cases, but also the edge ones.

### When coding...

- Try different approaches. Think about patterns that could fit. Sometimes, reversing the problem is a good approach.
- Define a great test plan, including average and edge cases.
- Work on code performance: Your solution will be tested in extreme cases, so time measuring and performance testing could find issues in those cases.
- Make the code understandable: Indentation, proper variables names, etc. If you are using an IDE that supports linting, use it.
- Control the remaining time: Keep enough time to submit your solution without rushing.


## 3. Submit the code

- Include a readme and inline comments that could be relevant for the reviewer.
- Remove console outputs from the code. They could make some tests failing by timeout errors.
- In case you have coded on an external programming tool, don't forget to bring the latest code to the online platform.
- Re-run the tests to be sure they pass before submitting it.


## Conclusion

There is not a magical formula to pass coding tests, but taking into consideration things like the ones described before could make your test more achievable.
Happy coding!
